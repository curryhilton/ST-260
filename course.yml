description      : In this Introduction to Statistical Inference with R course, you will master the basics of statistical inference at the undergraduate level, including data and visualizations, probability and distributions,                inference (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and parameter estimation), and simple linear regression. With the knowledge gained in this course, you will be ready to leverage fundamental statistics                 and R to perform statistical data analysis.
